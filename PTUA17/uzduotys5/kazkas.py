# Create 3 separate list . One list contains shopt items, another list - prices, and last list 
# amount.
# Ask user to enter the number of item baskets she/he wants to create (min 5 buckets max 10).
# Basket is created by randomly picking one value from each list (items,price,amount)
# Example bucket = {"item":toy, "price": 35, "amount": 56}

# Created buckets are put in a final list.

# Wich item is with lowest price? Which item has most monetary value in store?
# There can be only different items on the final list (can't be same item in different buckets)
# Collapse
# has context menu
